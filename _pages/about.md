Hi, I'm Patrick. I live and work in Boston, MA. Specifically, I work in Digital Health, trying to find/understand/solve problems for patients using technology. My hobbies include reading, walks, running, watching soccer, and buying records. I write about any and all of the above.

Things I'm up to:
-Playing Link's Awakening on Switch
-In love with Low's - "HEY WHAT" album
-Still reading "Hummingbird Salamander" by Jeff Vandermeer
